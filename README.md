# Focus Wheel
The Focus Wheel is a customizable desk companion designed to help you stay focused, manage study sessions, and take effective breaks. Powered by an ESP32-C3, it features a rotary encoder, buzzer, LED ring, OLED display, and optional slider — all neatly packed into a 3D-printed enclosure.
This project combines hardware and software to provide:
- Multiple focus and break timers
- Visual and audible notifications
- Customizable controls via knob, button, and slider
- Expandability for future features (e.g., media control or BLE functionality)
Whether you're a student, maker, or just looking to build a functional productivity gadget, the Focus Wheel is a great weekend project — with lots of room for upgrades! Check out the in-depth [guide]() at instructables!

# Programming
Programmed with the Arduino IDE and ESP32 board manager. 
Install the following libraries:
- [DonutStudioTimer](https://github.com/KonradWohlfahrt/Arduino-Timer-Library)
- [RotaryEncoder](https://github.com/mathertel/RotaryEncoder)
- [FastLED](https://github.com/FastLED/FastLED)
- [U8g2](https://github.com/olikraus/u8g2)

**Uploading:**
Board: `ESP32C3 Dev Module`
Settings: default
Connection via USB cable.
Press the knob button (Flash) when powering up the device, it also seems uploading works without doing so.

# 3D Printing
Print `Housing Bottom` and one of the `Housing Top` options - depending on what components you would like to use. Finally, print both `Fading Knob` and `Knob`. Put in the six threaded heat inserts and screw everything together. The knobs slide on top.

# Functions
The following button functions are used in the examples:
- middle button: start timer, pause timer, change selection
- rotating middle button: change timer values or timers
- right button: edit timers, skip timers
- long press right button (only `Timer.ino`): save timer to eeprom
